# OrderedArrayList

Summary of discussion:
We thought we had to originally make ArrayList<>, but we reread the directions and we realized we didn't have to. We spent most of our time trying to get Arrays of type T to work it wasn't working out. In the end it was fine though we didn't get that much work done.

Takes in a type and creates an NoNullArrayList of that type.
